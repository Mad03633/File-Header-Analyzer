## Overview

This diploma project introduces a hybrid framework for file type identification and security analysis.
Unlike traditional methods that depend on file extensions or metadata (which are easily manipulated), our approach relies on intrinsic header configuration data and combines:

  - Signature-based identification (magic numbers, file headers).

  - Statistical entropy analysis to detect obfuscation/packing.

  - Structural validation against known format specifications.

  - Threat intelligence integration with VirusTotal for malware scanning.

Applications include digital forensics, malware detection, and data integrity verification.

## üî¨ Methodology
1. Data Collection

  - File header and MIME type data from:

    - MDN Web Docs

    - HackTheMatrix

    - Gary Kessler‚Äôs Repository

    - TrID

    - Real-world malicious samples from VirusShare

2. Database Integration

PostgreSQL backend with two primary datasets:

3. Analytical Framework

C++: High-performance header parsing and signature matching.

Python (FastAPI):

File upload and orchestration.

Entropy calculation.

Format validation.

VirusTotal integration.

React Frontend: User-friendly UI for uploading files and visualizing reports.

## Methodology

The project methodology is divided into the following key phases:

1. Data Collection:
- Aggregating header configuration data from reputable sources such as MDN Web Docs (for MIME types), HackTheMatrix (for file headers), Gary Kessler‚Äôs file signatures repository, and TrID.
- Incorporating real-world executable samples from VirusShare to validate the approach.

2. Database Creation and Integration:
- Building a PostgreSQL database populated with two primary datasets:
  - filenames.csv: Combines file header information, MIME type mappings, and signature data.
  - virusnames.csv: Contains metadata from executable samples to aid in malware detection.

3. Analytical Framework:
- Implementing a hybrid analysis approach that integrates:
  - Statistical and textual analysis to extract distinctive header features.
  - Visual analytics to enhance the interpretability of results.
- Leveraging both Python (for flexible analysis and rapid prototyping) and C++ (for performance-critical operations).

## Data Sources and Integration

The project integrates data from multiple high-quality sources to create a robust analytical framework:
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types): Provides comprehensive MIME type information.
- [HackTheMatrix](https://hackthematrixforlife.wordpress.com/file-headers/ ) & [Gary Kessler‚Äôs Repository](https://www.garykessler.net/library/file_sigs.html): Offer detailed insights into file headers and signature bytes.
- [TrID]( https://mark0.net/soft-trid-e.html): Supplies advanced binary signature identification techniques.
- [VirusShare](https://virusshare.com/): Delivers real-world executable samples for testing the reliability of the method.

## üß† Overview of Components

1. ‚öôÔ∏è main.cpp - Header Sorter & Virus Detector

This C++ module processes two CSV files:
- ```filenames.csv```: List of filenames and their header values.
- ```virusenames.csv```: List of known malicious header patterns (signatures).

üìå Features:
- Sorts files based on header signatures.
- Detects potential viruses by checking whether any known virus signature is present in the file header (case-insensitive substring match).
- Displays a warning for any suspicious file.

2. üîç pe_analyzer.py ‚Äî PE File Header Analyzer

This module uses the pefile library to analyze PE file structure and detect signs of packing or obfuscation.

üìå Features:
- Detects number of sections, timestamp, image size, and entry point.

- Calculates entropy of each section to detect signs of packing.

- Raises alerts if the SizeOfImage is abnormally large or section entropy is high.
